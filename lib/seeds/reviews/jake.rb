  { title: 'Midsommar', grade: 'A', description: "I... this... it... There are simply no other films like this, and anything that follows in the same vein will have a tough time living up to how utterly masterful this is. A brilliant, daylight nightmare. I've never been more stressed out at the movies. At one point I was genuinely feeling anxiety. Moments and images from this film will long be seared into my memory, but I cannot wait to see this again (and, probably, again). Florence Pugh is doing some fucking incredible work here. She brings it. All of it. Literally, the entire spectrum of human emotion. The production design and art direction are on another level. It's hauntingly gorgeous. Everything about this film is just...brilliant. At 2 hrs and 25 minutes, it still doesn't feel like enough. I want MORE. (Actually just read today that Aster is working on a directors cut with *at least* 30 more minutes of footage. Merry Christmas.) " },
  { title: "The Dead Don't Die", grade: 'A-', description: "It's the end of the world as we know it, and...this is going to end bad. This is the Mars Attacks of the 21st century that we deserve. A film made with such a specific brand of humor so perfectly curated to the comedy-receptors inside my brain that I think it knows me better than I know myself. Not a single moment, motif, reference, joke, or actor was wasted, nor overused. This will proudly sit atop my list in the number one position until it is inevitably knocked down a peg or two by \"Brad Pitt looks sexy in space fuckin with black holes or some shit\" (Ad Astra) or \"Willem Dafriend and Batman star in a movie that Robert Eggers and A24 inceptioned into my brain to make\" (The Lighthouse)." },
  { title: 'The Souvenir', grade: 'A-', description: "Joanna Hogg went and saw Phantom Thread AT LEAST 25 times. I don't know (at this moment) exactly what to say about this film, except that I loved it. Jokes aside, it's sort of spiritual sequel/companion/response to Phantom Thread. There's much to be said about this film, while the film itself doesn't say very much at all in the way of beating you over the head with its goings-on that most films, brilliantly conceived as they may be, tend to be guilty of doing these days. The film, its artistry, and its players allow you and you alone to think and chew on the quiet, subtle, cringey, wonderful, terrible, and thoughtful moments that make up this exquisitely fashioned film. For that, I'm eternally grateful, and it's all the more reason to love this film. Oh and Tilda \"The Machine\" Swinton? The woman could earn an Oscar in a single glance without saying a goddamm word. " },
  { title: 'The Farewell', grade: 'A-', description: "I've seen more than a few comments/complaints about the general one noteness concerning this film. I hear you, but I am so more than ok with it not being any more than what it is. If it were, the subject matter alone would demand that we steer dangerously close to melodrama and real triumph-of-the-human-spirit horseshit. For this film to work, the dryness and oftentimes un-spectacular-ness (that many may criticize) of a given scene, interaction, reaction, or look is an integral part of keeping it grounded, which is right where it belongs. We are getting some great work from a host of Chinese actors, chiefly among them Zhao Shuzhen as Nai Nai, as well as a measured and fine leading performance from Awkwafina. I don't know if I agree with the word \"revelatory\" that I've seen being thrown around re: her performance, but she quietly commands what moments are called for by her character and gracefully steps back to make way for what I imagine many people are not going to clock as a tight and smoothly operating ensemble. There is something that too often gets lost in translation, so to speak, between American audiences perception and the performance of a foreign actor, especially in their native language. The nuances of language and speech are difficult to convey across or between any two different languages, and an actor's performance can often be a casualty of that. The Farewell, under Lulu Wang's tight and clear direction, succeeds not only in bucking that misfortune (with the help of, again, a finely tuned and thoroughly likeable ensemble) but gracefully pulls the concept into the thematic spotlight by exploring what it means to be of one culture as opposed to a polar opposite or, in the film's case, what it's like to be part of both. I'm not sure I can point to a film that succeeds more in showcasing a foreign culture, way of life, or the inner mechanations of a family, with all their ties and duties to one another. How many films about or that take place within a foreign culture wind up looking like a tourism ad, with a host of groanable scenic montages and tired-as-fuck character arcs that start as rebellion against native culture, turned head on interactions with and tribulations against it, turned happilyeverafter understanding and acceptance and Full House lesson learned dumbfuckery. The Farewell never even comes close. Is it perfect? No. Few films are. But I don't need this one to be to know that I've watched something special." },
  { title: 'Toy Story 4', grade: 'A-', description: "An epilogue you didn't know you needed, a post script that could easily be written off as unnecessary fanfiction if it didn't hit so hard emotionally. A film about grappling with meaning, and how sometimes getting lost is really the only way to find yourself. For my money, the Toy Story franchise is, to date, the most successful series of films in that each one serves to do justice to and raise the bar from its predecessor. Thanks for the memories and the existential crisis, Pixar." },
  { title: 'The Man Who Killed Don Quixote', grade: 'A-/B+', description: "A strange and bonkers dreamlike journey that could have only come from the mind of Terry Gilliam. You’ll either love it, or walk out after about 35 minutes. And here I sit, during the credits, with a big stupid grin on my face. The very existence of this film hinges upon having been made with the cinematic toolbox of someone only like Gilliam, who has, across decades in the industry, discovered and cartwheeled across the limitless planes upon which a film can take form. No rules are followed, or rather, only Gilliam’s rules are followed. Don’t knock it if you don’t vibe with it. Just walk away and leave it for those of us with whom it clicks. A real trip." },
  { title: 'Booksmart', grade: 'B+', description: "What can I say? I'm a sucker for a whip-smart coming of age story that takes no prisoners. The leading ladies rock, Billie Lourde is a force, the rest that round out the cast (kids and adults) knock what little or a lot they have to work with out of the park, and Olivia Wilde pulls it all off with such great focus while never once sacrificing an ounce of the fun and frenzy. Fun fun fun. Let yourself have fun." },
  { title: 'The Last Black Man in San Fransisco', grade: 'A-', description: "Nearly every frame of this film is painfully gorgeous, tiny little works of art that are strung together to make one 2-hour long masterpiece of modern cinema. It proudly boasts an atypical mode of storytelling, both in its thematic and technical elements. What more is there to say? If one were to argue that they wanted less of this, or more of that, or so on, then the film simply would not be what it is, and that feels just plain wrong, in every ethical and artistic sense. A real triumph of the beauty of filmmaking, storytelling, and performance– chiefly among the performative components is Jonathan Majors, who is just as much a force when he's at a 1 as he is at a 10. Every single moment of his character and performance is earned, be it conveyed through nuance or explosion. This is the first male performance I've seen this year that's a worthy name for the year-end awards conversations and, for my money, a real contender for Best Supporting Actor, if only the film's questionably early summer release does not sully its awards prospects. A24 is a strong enough player now, though, that when they've got something this magic, they know what to do with it. " },
  { title: 'High Life', grade: 'A-', description: "I don’t know if I can, in good conscience, recommend that anyone rush out to see this film. At the same time: rush out to see it. But know that I told you, right now, you probably aren’t going to like it, as evidenced in part by the 6 different people that walked out of the showing I was in (3 of them left during a scene in which mad witch space scientist convict Juliette Binoche enters The Fuckbox– yes, that’s the name of the room– and straddles a silver dildo machine in an erotic sequence that lasts for more than a full minute, which feels like an eternity when you are watching JULIETTE BINOCHE MASTURBATING ON A SILVER DILDO MACHINE IN A ROOM CALLED THE FUCKBOX). This film isn’t concerned with giving you answers, nor is it remotely concerned with anything related to its “genre” other than subverting the notion that it even is a science fiction film. Technically, it is, of course. But Claire Denis certainly doesn’t care about that. She’s made some art, some really weird art, with Fuckboxes and space sex and sperm experiments and Mia Goth’s head exploding in the density of a black hole. Denis is not interested in making something that serves anything other than the vision in her mind, and she’s just so good that she’s allowed to do exactly that. And, in my opinion, she pulls it off with flying, cum-drenched colors." },
  { title: 'Avengers: Endgame', grade: 'B+', description: "The culmination of 20+ films and 11 years proves to be one of the most successful ideas that the film industry has ever had with this fitting conclusion. I’ve not enjoyed, nor been more wholly satisfied with, a film (or series, for that matter) to this extent in years. Not because it’s the greatest film of all time, not because it isn’t without its hang ups, but as a fan of the genre, the creative team, the stories, the characters, and the adventures across those 11 years, I feel a sense of satisfaction that no other film in recent memory has achieved. And that’s a rare feat for such a gargantuan endeavor of the Hollywood machine, which churns out 1 piece of gold for every 1000 pieces of shit. We love things because they bring us joy, foster fun, instill wonder, and inspire creativity, and the MCU is no exception, with this film offering an emotionally incredible sense of completion to something that’s been such an enormous part of my growing up as a movie lover. While it serves as the end of an era, it simultaneously ushers in the next and new age of the MCU, much to our collective giddiness and intrigue, and I am so here for it." },
  { title: 'High Flying Bird', grade: 'B+', description: "The first film I've seen this year, and it sets a high bar for others to come. An insanely good script that gets unfortunately mired by the fact that it was shot on an iPhone, despite my support for its acessibility as a new lens through which films can be born. Full(er) review: https://boxd.it/DrTCJ" },
  { title: 'Captain Marvel', grade: 'B+', description: "Super cool and a lot of fun, which is ultimately what I’ve been invested in the MCU for since the beginning. It also doesn’t hurt when your cast is led by such formidable talents as Brie Larson, Ben Mendelssohn, Jude Law, Samuel L. Jackson, and Lashana Lynch, plus the ever-impressive grounding courtesy of directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck. A necessary step in the journey to the Endgame, and an origin story told in an exciting, cheeky, and subversive fashion. One of the best Marvel movies? No, not top of the list. One of the better Marvel movies, especially in its place as an essential component of the greater whole? Hands down." },
  { title: 'Paddleton', grade: 'B', description: "There's something to be said for a movie that plainly lays out exactly where it's going and exactly what fate the characters are going to meet but still makes you cry when the time comes to actually see it. Easily one of the saddest films I've ever seen, but I'd be lying if I said there wasn't a smile on my face by the end of it. The Duplass Brothers are a hell of a team, and understand the mundanity and the natural drama in utter simplicity unlike anyone else. They know how to blow you away without ever really doing anything all that explosive. It's possible their style is not for everyone, and that makes more than enough sense. I loved it. Nuff said." },
  { title: 'Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood', grade: 'B-', description: "Hmm... All of Tarantino's films feel so iconic, but this one... They are all so unmistakably TARANTINO, but this one... I have a lot to say about this. See my full review: https://boxd.it/LS7vB" },
  { title: 'Detective Pikachu', grade: 'C+', description: "I needed something fun today and this didn’t disappoint. Hokey, dumb, and not allowed to employ a lick of subtlety, what with it being a kids movie and all, it still succeeds in making Pokémon look cute and giving a Ryan Reynolds yet another platform on which to be entertaining. Cool. " },
  { title: 'Us', grade: 'B', description: "The score & Lupita’s performance were the two immediate takeaways that really hit me the right way. While I sniffed out that twist from a mile away, the way it played out was done with care and high caliber intellect, as we’ve come to appreciate from this new filmmaking master Jordan Peele. While it’s not a film I’m likely to revisit any time soon, I will certainly be thinking about it as it soaks in deeper in the weeks to come. At the end of the day, to me, this is a popcorn flick. While it’s infinitely smarter than most other popcorn flicks, it’s still just that. Which is perfectly fine, except when you look at it as largely being more of movie than a film. And with a concept this brilliant, I guess I would prefer to see it given a slightly more artistic treatment. Not my favorite, but great job everyone. Jordan Peele fucks." },
  { title: 'Velvet Buzzsaw', grade: 'B-', description: "Very dumb but kind of fun. Garish is the first word that comes to mind. Jake Gyllenhaal's delivery of some lines is genuinely hilarious, and the best part of the movie. Full review:  https://boxd.it/Dyi7X" },
  { title: 'Under the Silver Lake', grade: 'C+', description: "David Robert Mitchell is doing some interesting stuff with his camera and lights. No one can say he's not a filmmaker of some technical imagination, even if said imagination is entirely lifted from the Hitchcock playbook. Nothing wrong with homage, nor is there anything wrong with thematic and visual nods to one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, but moment after moment after moment lean a little too far into the gimmick, and it gets tired fast. The script is...not enough to keep me from picking up my phone every 5 minutes and playing a game where I'm a hole in the ground that expands in size the more cars and buildings I eat, but it's so not bad enough to make me shut it off. Andrew Garfield is so painfully Acting (with a capital A) that it's impossible to take him seriously in anything he does (even in this film where, yeah, you aren't supposed to be taking anything seriously). Remember when he said he's gay but he's not interested in having sex with men? I remember. \"Gay without the physical acts,\" I believe was the direct quote. This has nothing to do with the film, just reminding you that this Academy Award nominated actor is not to be taken seriously. Also, he kind very obviously of can't help but to still pose and move like Spider-Man sometimes. Let it go, Andrew, let it go. Ultimately, it feels like David Robert Mitchell was trying to do David Lynch by way of a pinch more logic, and it never really lands. I reckon that this all looked a lot more attractive on paper than what the final product turned out to be. There's an interesting concept buried somewhere underneath the bloated cinematic self-indulgence, and a possibly interesting mystery to boot, but no one, least of all the impossible-to-take-seriously-as-a-normie Andrew Garfield. That being said, I recognize that maybe there's something to be said for this film, and maybe I need to look at it from a different angle. Change my mind." },
  { title: 'Triple Frontier', grade: 'C+', description: "A letdown, given what this film could have been based on the players involved. Struts itself about like it deserves to be in line with the likes of Zero Dark Thirty and Sicario but, when push comes to shove, misses the mark by a longshot." },
  { title: 'Black Mirror: Bandersnatch', grade: 'C++', description: "Get it? C++? Because computers? The gimmick of this movie is cool, and I'm sure we'll see it more often in the years to come, but I hope that next time they put some more depth into the storytelling. Write a real film then go back and make it a choose your own adventure maybe? I dunno, that's not really my department. There was just something exceptionally lackluster about the film itself." },
  { title: 'Poms', grade: 'D', description: "I saw this with my grandmother. I...don’t think I need to go to great lengths to describe how unsuccessful it was. You all can probably gather that for yourselves." },
  { title: 'Them That Follow', grade: 'D', description: "Wildly unsuccessful in everything it sets out to do. At least there were moments of POMS that I enjoyed." }
