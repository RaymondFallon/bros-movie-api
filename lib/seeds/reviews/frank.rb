  { title: 'Midsommar', description: "Here she comes boys, she's back on her Mary Queen of Scots bullshit. The first time I sat down for Midsommar, I walked out twenty minutes in, when the magnitude of Dani’s tragedy was getting swept aside so we could get into some ****art horror.*** But also I thought it may have been the day I was having, so I came back! In returning, I wanted to walk out a bunch more times. Unlike Hereditary (mad respect, feels an inch emptier after this slog) Midsommar proposes almost-too-much trauma not as something to be worked with (with hands filmically/ creationally, frame by frame by the fucking filmmaker) but as an excuse to lob shroom-addled shots at Christian/Pagan/ & hetero-norm/ taboo ideologies without deciding what any of that meant to poor Florence Pugh, who is working v v hard and doing v v good work. Also doing good work is Pawel Pogorzelski, whose frames and lights find the reasonable nightmares in our desparate dreams. But all that formal sweat and vigor for what? To flip the camera over to show you’ve seen The Shining? Anthropology, which gets a flimsy cameo, is the study of human beings as they relate to the culture they make in the systems they live in; Midsommar feels like a study of the system of a culture (horror movies) without much time spent on humans. Which inadvertently positions it opposite its yearly doppelganger, Us. OR: When our American/ London avatars wretch in reaction to the elders brutal leap from the cliffs we’re assured that there’s precedent for this. We’re assured that the brutality is in service of something greater that we’re too provincial to understand. And I think Ari Aster might respond the same way if I was to poke about Midsommar. " },
  { title: 'Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood', description: "I. What was the first story you were told? Did it thrill and shake you violently, did it warn you against or convince you of? Was it yours or someone else’s? Did you recognize-- when did you recognize?-- that it was part of a larger fabric, that its disparate symbols and signs were both of and above reality you were living? When did you tell your first story? II. Remember: \"I didn't ask for the whole story.\" III. Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood is a fairytale and a myth, a story of and above the reality we live in. Its story unfolds and refolds frustratingly with little focus on plot-- this is obviously a practical flaw. But it works in favor of refiguring how plot (our plot, an American one) could support a story (our story, a personal one.) It works to change how we support our sequences. Sharon Tate, long understood as the martyred angel in our (hi)story here isn’t a player or a prayer party: Sharon Tate is the story. She is rendered in flesh, has wants and teeth, laughs, dances. She survives. IV. If she’s the story, she’s not the actor in it. This too is frustrating, like so so many of the facets of this feature. Tarantino’s work is fraught with the frustrations of pop(corn) cinema. Purging those frustrating fast-and-loose relationships to race and gender and violence would sap what keeps this cinema’s stakes thrilling. That doesn’t mean they belong in our story. All those myriad rank projections here might rankle us beyond reconciliation. I don’t blame you for turning away. V. But try to remember: \"What's the idea of the story?\" VI. A flailing man finds grace in his failures. An imperfect superman tries, always, to care. These fractured men, a glitchy and scratchy Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, are this fairy tale's actors. They work together. And a dog helps. A child has wisdom. A woman sees herself and smiles, without the men, beyond their comprehension, mostly. Her existence (and that of her friends and her child) isn’t tied symbolically to the cultural and political moors of America; instead it’s simply a life worth imagining. We come to understand her by her work and the pride she has in it instead of what the way she was killed meant. That predatory specter too long understood as inevitable is granted so little screen deference that we’re prompted, as spectators to our own story, to remember that we don’t have to be beholden to the actions of our worst angels. You can fault this vision for being overly sentimental, for not thinking carefully enough about its revisionary violence, but you (*I*) can’t fault the work its hands are in. What if what was doesn’t have to be understood in the ways we’ve always understood it? What if we could see the stories we’ve always told and somehow change the ideas in them? Would that help how we stride forward, out of a cinema’s darkness into light? This keening reeling ninth film, part eulogy and part devotional, somehow feels like a first story. "},
  { title: 'High Life', description: "In [monks and fucks and getting off and coming home are all just incongruent ways of navigating] space no one can hear you [s]cream."},
  { title: 'Under the Silver Lake', description: "At our most broken, we look to the world for signs and symbols we can adopt and adapt to our own brokenness-- maybe if we find a hidden meaning, we can piece ourselves back up and paper over what hurts. Sometimes we look too hard, focus too recklessly, and spin out. Under the Silver Lake, all Tinder-fucked Hitchcock and horrortribute to an uncaring, unfazed L.A., has careful sympathy for its stunted hero (a gross and fascinating smudge of nuance from Garfield) but also makes clear, even at its most absurd, that nobody is entitled to more than anyone else, and that often, our boundless and toxic entitlement is what staunches real healing. “It might help. Some unconditional love.”"},
  { title: 'Serenity', description: "Such a spitstab in the face of good taste, so deleriously committed to the architecture of its story that Serenity stands as a genuine article of liberating freakdom in the shadow of Marvel's Cinema of Inevitability (logical evolutionary ancestors in recent years include Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, mother!, and The Neon Demon.) Diane Lane wears a kimono and McConaughey achieves Cageian flight and by the time the turns and swerves of this burlesque beast simmered down, I was stupefied at how moved I was."},
  { title: 'Braid', description: "The decay of narrative set to the stakes of opera, the hallucination of childhood trauma re-membered as metaphor and then immediately bled back as something real and dangerous in our world. Peirone and her three actresses take such glee in subverting and ignoring our expectations of how this is supposed to unfold and in that process, laugh themselves into a kind of cinema free and above the one we’ve come to expect. This'll slit the skim off your eyeballs. We laugh and recoil and wretch and even if we don't like it, we've never seen like this before. "},
  { title: 'High Flying Bird', description: "As Soderbergh sets his scales increasingly smaller (a handheld lens, a miniaturizing cinema) the focus of his filmmmaking cuts sharper. As McCraney's screenplays look farther up at the world they sing (those who make, take; those who need, wilt) they indict that world's systems to the point where change feels not only possible but necessary. High Flying Bird is cinematically a revolution, a way to shift the lens. But its suggestion of games on games, of disruption as a legitimate form of moving toward tomorrow, is a revolution offscreen in waiting."},
  { title: 'Us', description: "Where are we? Peele’s filmography so far (including Keanu!) is of American bodies, our meaty containers and the sometimes unknowable, always unquestionably precious cargo inside it. Get Out submerged us in void before it urged us to take our skins back; Us reanimates you until you’re just familiar, a choppy returning that almost has your smell. It’s not elegant or subtle, and it’s not really a “horrifying” horror film. But Peele’s willingness to steep in the unhomely, conjuring instances of just-so to shove our nose in shit we already smell as he spreads genre trappings on our toasted social world is where Us thrills and flies, a genuinely American film. Who do we deny when we live our days with smiles at skies? Us."},
  { title: 'Unicorn Store', description: "A pastelled chirp for and from the wonder-fully confused! Larson's more-is-more mise en scene and knack for strong collaborators (Joan! Cusack!) result in a universe just-sideways of reality that actually and subtlely has more to say about our relation to realness than our misgivings about growing up."},
  { title: 'Doubles vies', description: "A comic crisis of meaning makers and matter trackers hashing out art via person and back again. While I don't doubt Assayas is intrigued by the current climate of the publishing world, most of Double vies feels like a (pleasantly) barely veiled stand-in for filmmaking itself. That it doesn't get too holy or clever or precious with solutions or diagnoses works in its favor. The quintet of actors ably spit and stitch criticism and work hard enough to justify the film's ending sequence, which is something like a positive shrug: maybe the absurdity of making poetry (or films or children or love or change) is less absurd than the absurdity of not. "},
  { title: 'Toy Story 4', description: "A coda is a thing for when you know you wrote the right ending but the story isn't over."},
  { title: 'John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum', description: "The sequel, as Dante, suggests: \"consider your origins.\" Every action (film) has consequences. Parabellum stokes the story's ascent into a pure and neon choreography while still enacting that action in the body of a character lost and broken/ re-lost and unbroken at every turn. John Wick wants nothing more than to disgard his bruteness. The world will not allow him. The fallout violence is hard to stomach but never romantic and always considered; violence must be subject to consequence or else it becomes cruelty. And when the film begs John Wick what he wants most of all, it surprises him/ us by challenging him/ us: living simply to remember love lost is not enough to call a life. At the film's tilted end, it wants us to consider something beyond that empty rememberance. Instead, as we hurtle towards another sequel, another consequence, we must consider active- maybe action- love. That's the only way to change a world. I hope the next sequel tries to change a world. "},
  { title: 'The Perfection', description: "Shamelessly trashy, gloriously campy shock yuck fun. It's about as nuanced as a cleaver to the forearm but it's good to see fetishistic horror-style violence taken up against (SPOILER) serial sexual abusers."},
  { title: 'Miss Bala', description: "Behind the genre trapping is the suggestion of a vice gripping the world: men on every side of the law will always betray and manipulate women. Hardwicke commits to that purpose again and again in how closely she frames her hero (Gina Rodriguez, GREAT, should be in everything) and trades endless shootouts for female comradeship and pointless badassery for the simple, un-fetishized extermination of bad men. "},
  { title: 'A Vigilante', description: "Soulful and "},
  { title: 'Godzilla: King of the Monsters', description: "Dazzlingly stupid; infuriatingly fun. The CG is mostly bad with flashes of true beauty (MOTHRA INNOCENT!) but lacks any sense of weight because, you know, it's not real. And yikes, that weightless, smoky animation is a cool third of what you watch. In a smart smart stroke the film enlists Erik Aadahl (of A Quiet Place & Transformers: Dark Side of the Moon!) for sound design and the blurbles and grumbles and skritches and roars, emminating from kaiju and Orca alike, help us believe (aurally! and with our ears, which lead directly into our heads) that our monsters might exist. And somehow dumhow that's the philosophy in this wreckfest: our inner monsters have volcanic avatars and our cinema needs a grief for what might be our inevitable end."},
  { title: 'Arctic', description: "Happily and thankfully forgoes any mandate that the machismo survival epic-- either arthouse (The Revenant) or Hollywood (Castaway)-- has to celebrate exceptional man-ness. Arctic is instead closer to The Witch or Meek's Cutoff in showcasing a wilderness that obliterates arbitrarily/ proposing a will that survives not by weathering the wild but admitting it is of it. I don't know: there's a lot in the little that's here, which is probably the only note Mads Mikkelsen needed."},
  { title: 'Captain Marvel', description: "More fun than most recent Marvel Inc. flix! Satisfyingly resists being a '90s nostalgia-fest while still playing the right songs and features a video gamely invincible hero who still exists in a story with stakes. It's still shilling progressiveness for a buck, but unlike Black Panther, the filmmakers are allowed to wriggle under that pitch and come up with something almost coherent to say about me and memory, refugees and opressors, and lies we believe and lies we fight. "},
  { title: 'Paddleton', description: "Mark Duplass is great & Ray Romano is not & the first sixty minutes are woof & the last twenty will kill you & bravo for a soapy film being pro-death"},
  { title: 'Midsommar', description: "Here she comes boys, she's back on her Mary Queen of Scots bullshit. The first time I sat down for Midsommar, I walked out twenty minutes in, when the magnitude of Dani’s tragedy was getting swept aside so we could get into some ****art horror.*** But also I thought it may have been the day I was having, so I came back! In returning, I wanted to walk out a bunch more times. Unlike Hereditary (mad respect, feels an inch emptier after this slog) Midsommar proposes almost-too-much trauma not as something to be worked with (with hands filmically/ creationally, frame by frame by the fucking filmmaker) but as an excuse to lob shroom-addled shots at Christian/Pagan/ & hetero-norm/ taboo ideologies without deciding what any of that meant to poor Florence Pugh, who is working v v hard and doing v v good work. Also doing good work is Pawel Pogorzelski, whose frames and lights find the reasonable nightmares in our desparate dreams. But all that formal sweat and vigor for what? To flip the camera over to show you’ve seen The Shining? Anthropology, which gets a flimsy cameo, is the study of human beings as they relate to the culture they make in the systems they live in; Midsommar feels like a study of the system of a culture (horror movies) without much time spent on humans.

  { title: 'Hellboy', description: "I'll rep GdT's Hellboys until they freeze over, but there's room enough in this supersaturated Marvelscape for another rendition in slightly different key. Marshall and his crew (working on a third of a Disneyfied budget) pump up the gore and play a rock-dumb action film in a horror universe. This is getting panned but it's halfway to hella fun."},
  { title: 'Mapplethorpe', description: "I just don't think biopics are great ways of disseminating wonder, or even art. And that's a shame, because Ondi Timoner's documentary-eye (and tendency to insert Super 8 footage between the *important* takes) has almost enough wheels and whips to infuse an otherwise biopicky drip flick. Matt \"the Doctor Who\" Smith does a workmanlike job bridging the long timeline Mapplethorpe tries to track in its title character's life, buuuut I also wish they'd found a gay actor to play a gay man whose whole artistic language was queering and cocking everything from catholicism to the avant garde. Mostly the movie doesn't even come close to the raw charge of the photos it shows so let's Bros Film Club field trip to the Guggenheim sometime?"},
  { title: 'Velvet Buzzsaw', description: "I keep managing to erase this specific comment? Anyway Jake Gyllenhaal is magic (Mysterio!), go watch Soapdish."},
  { title: 'Happy Death Day 2U', description: "Plucky indie horror with brains yields funny sci-fi sequel with heart! I almost cried and I laughed out loud three times and I will watch at least 3 more of these if they're all this excited to exist in the world. Also! This was made for 191 million (!) dollars less than Alita! YOU GUYS!"},
  { title: 'Avengers: Endgame', description: "It's the biggest and baldest motion away from the spectacular into the (corporatized) spectacle but there's still a whole lot to defend here. The care encouraged by the Russos and practiced by ever actor in treating these old plastic totems as live moments in our sweaty world is both admirable and joyful. And somewhere in all of it is a spindly, precious thread about the lasting effect of trauma on helplessness and hope, how heroism is something like getting over how we oppress ourselves. But goddamn goddamn it's *this* close to ruined when you allow Cap to forsake that lesson that he finally integrated into his being (above all else you must move on) and send himself back into a past that never happened. It's supposed to be lovely but it's fanservice masking the puerile belief that getting what you missed is better than living with what you've learned and I am not not down with it friends."},
  { title: 'Glass', description: "Shyamalan's insistence that Marvel Inc. isn't an inevitability is a Good Thing. M. Night is the most known filmmaker of color in America? and consistently makes movies people see? I think it's weird that he's a punchline when mostly he makes weirdly-paced and inquisitive if messy movies. This one's about disenfrancised voices taking control back from oppressors. That's good."},
  { title: 'Someone Great', description: "There's nothing inherently new about Someone Great's reliance on rom-com tropes and expectations, so the realities the film feels obliged to uphold (figure things our in your 30s, settle down from your wild days) are formally systemic, not individual to this film. It's hard not to take them a little more personally, though because Someone Great goes out of its way to deal in 2019/ millenialish details; it's just weird when a fluff film drops music criticism on its lead character and then doesn't care even a little bit critically about what that means (for her lifestyle, for her ambitions) aside from plopping a Mitski and Phoebe Bridgers banger to peak us. Again: exploiting personal traits sans examination is what a lot of not-great rom-commage does, and it's fine that Jennifer Kaytin Robinson does it here. I was just always hoping for better, because Robinson has some great ideas and a pair of romantic leads in Rodriguez and Stanfield with *chemistry* and that doesn't happen all the time! "},
  { title: 'Tolkien', description: "This does half a gesture of good work in suggesting that art is no excuse for suffering, or rather, suffering is not a neccesary stop towards good art. Tolkien's formidable, joyful oeuvre does not exist specifically because he lived and lost through the Great War. A lesser biopic would have missed that. And more films would do well to rob war and cruelty of their mythology as good fodder or necessary crucibles for artistry. But also \"I am a bit tired of being told by the writer that the protagonist is extremelely talented\" (Curt) and this film is 100% less interesting than reading The Hobbit or watching The Return of the King."},
  { title: 'Detective Pikachu', description: "I'm paraphrasing Ray, but he said it best: you can write better for 8 year-olds/ you have to write better for 8 year-olds. The Hobbit is for 8 year-olds. A Wrinkle in Time is for 8 year-olds, and Holes and The Hate You Give. Pokemon is for eight year-olds too. There most invigorating a feeling at 8 is not knowing what's in the tall of the grass or the ink of the cave, of learning that you're smart enough to take the wilds of an adventure and all the time you've placed in an endeavour and emerge triumphant, better. And when you write a film that forgets and avoids those things, that directly talks down to us at 8/ us now and replaces wonder with pablum, it doesn't matter how good the CG is or how pre-programmed the nostalgia."},
  { title: 'Pet Sematary', description: "I watched about half of Mary Lambert's original adaptation before Amazon shuttled it away; at least Pet Sematary (1989) had the gall to be cheesily weird and gross. King's woods usually have the ring of the eternal beyond the simply monstrous but this non-specifically gray re-take sets up lots of scares and doesn't follow them all the way in. "},
  { title: 'Greta', description: "I mean, this is a b a d screenplay and forty minutes too long and doesn't read as *real* (you have to ignore so many plot contrivances to make it work) or *fairy tale* (a feeling it sniffs at but never commits to because the screenplay is B A D.) But also, I really appreciate the pieces and edges it sets out on the board, even if they never get built and obviously Huppert is doing promethean work, just loony enough, sorta sinister-like."},
  { title: 'Alita: Battle Angel', description: "Like Spy Kids but not fun! Like podracing but not cinematic! Like eating a whole bag of Skittles! A! whole! bag! "},
  { title: 'Replicas', description: "NOT GREAT NOT GREAT just watch the John Wick 3 trailer for 147 (!) minutes instead."},
  { title: 'Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened', description: "Oh man I felt so bad after watching this. Like, not enlightened or enlivened, just gross. That's mostly due to Fyre itself, but I think the doc's complete unwillingness to pursue or persecute it in any workable way (ie: this is what we have to do with all this information) is just as lame also it's co-produced by Jerry Media which is a metric ton of bullshit."}
