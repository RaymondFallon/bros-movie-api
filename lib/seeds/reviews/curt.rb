  { title: 'Midsommar', description: "Ari Aster builds a world in his films in which people and specifically families (and communities) are the source of the horror.  Families, literal and figurative, trap you, forcing you to accept their rules, their lunacy, legacy, and damage.  In Midsommar, Florence Pugh's Dani is ripped by tragedy from one deeply damaged family and eventually trapped in a deranged murderous Swedish cult/family.  This film, like Hereditary, is not so much scary as it is unsettling.  What really works is how Aster's painstaking storytelling uses the structure and conventions of a horror film to explore some of the darkest feelings and impulses that people carry with them.  Aster is also so good at exploring the micro-horrors that exist within the story: Christian trapped in a relationship with a woman he desperately wants to break up with, the bros trapped on a vacation with their friend's bummer girlfriend, Dani's ever-present grief that weighs on her every second of the film.  Not as tight as Hereditary, Midsommar felt a little long to me, perhaps lingering too often when the point had been made.  Also, some of the sub-plotting with the bros is a bit flimsy.  Still, it is a brazen, funny, disturbing, impressive film.    On a second viewing, I wondered, does one only move on from a bad relationship once everything has burned?" },
  { title: 'The Art of Self-Defense', description: "This is a pitch black comedy about toxic masculinity set in an indetermined time period (a useful choice) in a somewhat dystopian version of Detroit/St. Louis/Milwaukee/Buffalo/Kansas City/Tulsa/Pittsburgh (ditto).  The filmmaker (Riley Stearns) and his actors navigate effortlessly through this twisted story of an awkward milquetoast (Jesse Eisenberg, superb) and the karate master (Alessandro Nivola, perfect) who inspires him to a more acceptable threshold of masculinity.  The film is never telling us how to feel, but because Eisenberg takes such good care of his sad sack character, we love and root for him even as his actions grow...immoral.  As the lone female with a speaking role, Imogen Poots gives us a thoughtful, intelligent, and funny take on a woman slogging through a hyper-masculine world.  Occasionally the dialogue gets a bit Lobster-eque, but overall, this was pretty great.  Proof that the dystopia is here...and looks like this." },
  { title: 'Us', description: "Okay.  Now I've seen this twice, and some of it is indeed amazing.  Lupita Nyong'o is incredible and better be nominated for an Oscar; both of those characters were so expertly performed and so chillingly different.  The photography and the music were operating at a very high level.  The opening song (which Jackie credited to \"The Hanoi Children's Choir\") was deliciously creepy.  But on a second viewing, I'm not convinced these terrific individual elements are adding up to much.  I guess I wanted the story and the metaphor(s) to be a bit tighter.  If Get Out had a bigger budget, that somewhat cheesy-looking brain-transplant (?) sequence would have lived up to the incredible writing.  Here, the climactic sequence looked much better than the writing required it to.  On doppelgangers, today a man on a bike in Asbury knocked on my car window and told me \"Man, I thought you was Pitbull.\"" },
  { title: 'Gloria Bell', description: "The trailer suggests that this film, starring the amazing Julianne Moore (another worthy Oscar nom, please), is a somewhat upbeat romance for the middle-aged set.  It's much darker and more foreboding than that.  The film really benefits from a writer/director who is fairly new to working in English - HOLY SHIT...I just looked him up and he directed last year's disaster, Disobedience - he really dispenses with some of the conventions of American filmmaking and that lets the story (and Gloria) rip.  The director and Ms. Moore are ultimately exploring the life of a middle-aged mother whose children no longer \"need\" her but whose own need to take care is still quite intense.  She has to figure out where to allocate that energy in a world that seems, at times, to be leaving her behind.  There's a lot more going on here, but...I've already written too much." },
  { title: 'The Farewell', description: "I really liked this.  Lulu Wang's film explores the complicated relationship a Chinese-American woman (Awkwafina) has with China when she returns there to see her dying grandmother.  In The Farewell, family makes \"home\" more than geography does but both can contribute to a sense of alienation.  Awkwafina's Billi stuggles, it seems, to have hit a stride in New York (thegreatestcityintheworld): we never see her thriving or even with friends.  In China, though, she's also an outsider: her Chinese is constantly criticized and she culturally \"too American\" to fit in there, even with her family.  A plot point in the film - that the g'mother is not told she has cancer - seems at first to be a jumping off point to explore some unique chinoiserie, but really it just ends up highlighting elements of Billi's family that feel universal which made the film more naturally than manipulatively moving.  I really loved all three actors (Awkwafina, Diana Lin & Shuzhen Zhao) at the center of this film. " },
  { title: 'The Last Black Man in San Fransisco', description: "There is a LOT of filmmaking going on here and a lot of it is really beautiful: the city and these characters are shot lovingly.  The themes of personal history and literal and figurative homebuilding were interesting and mostly worked well.  I'm left with a feeling, though, that all of the music and the painstaking cinematography and the stylized, (at times) highly mannered performances act as a smoke screen through which you are not meant to see that the story is flimsy and that the lead actor (Jimmie Fails) doesn't really have any gas in the tank.  His primary scene partner (Jonathan Majors) does, but his character is wrtitten somewhat haphazardly.  I think the movie was working very hard to get me to feel something (please don't), but I didn't and wasn't sure what I was supposed to in the first place: perhaps a stronger performance would have clarified that.  Still, I admired and was entertained by its frequent originality and its intense focus on a location I don't really know anything about." },
  { title: 'Doubles vies', description: "The French title of this film is Double Vies (Double Lives) which is...not as fitting as the English title.  Maybe in French, the phrase double lives doesn't have the connotation it does in English.  Anyway, this film is a pretty interesting meditation on the changing landscape of the publishing world.  Its characters grapple with the digital age and the influence it has on their work and, in a sense, the world they know/knew.  The film kind of flattens out though when it focuses on the marital and extramarital relationships of its characters.  A bunch of fairly privileged professionals cheating on each other is kind of who cares territory for me.  It's much more successful when its characters are riffing on twitter, e-readers, and auto-fiction.  Perhaps a more substantive plot on which to hang these discussions would have helped." },
  { title: 'Wild Nights with Emily', description: "Molly Shannon as Emily Dickinson.  She's a really terrific actor when she gets the chance.  This is a funny, odd, somewhat engaging film about Emily Dickinson and the obstacles she faced as a female writer in her era.  Not surprisingly, the film manages to feel quite modern in its thematic explorations.  There are some problems, though.  A frame story about the woman who first edited and published Dickinson falls flat due to a hacky performance and some unimaginitive writing and storytelling.  The film definitely suffers from having a clearly thin budget: some of the bit players are amateurish and some of the design is...Scaramouchey.  Still, when Shannon and her primary scene partner, Susan Ziegler (as Dickinson's long-time love) are the focus, the film really comes alive." },
  { title: 'Late Night', description: "Mindy Kaling is a very funny writer.  I laughed aloud many times at this film and I appreciated its story/message.  Ultimately though, MK is not a thorough writer.  The script needed at least one if not two more drafts: it's sloppy and lazy, hanging the responsibility of entertaining the audience on the actors.  There are two very lazy romantic subplots, and multiple scenes in which the incredible Emma Thompson must make lemonade out of...pampelmouses.  The script bites off a lot but doesn't take the time to really explore the complexities of the female dynamic in the workplace and in the arts, the non-white p-o-v, slut shaming.  Also, the bland interstitial music sanded any interesting edges off of this film." },
  { title: 'High Life', description: "Robert Pattinson is from England, and I have not forgotten.  Why he's doing this Brando/De Niro tortured badass accent...I do not know.  I appreciate that this is a talented filmmaker who has made a technically impressive film, but I could not have cared less about this story.  It's not a great sign when I'm watching a film and occasionally muttering to myself, \"who cares\".  A little plot never killed anyone.  The photography, music, and production design are all cool, but from my p-o-v there's not enough story to hang them on.  It's pretty self-indulgent in its pacing..." },
  { title: 'Booksmart', description: "This came recommended by some clams I know.  It had its moments but overall was not particularly successful.  It should surprise no one that I have not seen Superbad which is perhaps a male precursor to this piece, so it doesn't mean much to me that a film like that one was made for girls.  Still I really liked the leads and thought they both had some really lovely moments.  I also loved their devotion to each other.   But the world of the film was...confusing: sometimes grounded in reality, sometimes satirical, sometimes way too silly.  It's hard to not to think about Lady Bird (especially with Ms. Feldstein on board), and when I do, this seems like a pretty minor offering into the canon of teen films." },
  { title: "The Dead Don't Die", description: "I was entertained by this film but also seriously underwhelmed.  Funny but not funny enough.  Satirical but not satirical enough.  Self-aware but not self-aware enough.  It felt a bit like JJ just wanted to get a bunch of his friends together to make a movie.  I'll bet they had fun doing it, but someone has to watch it.  A little writing never killed anyone.  I have no context for the zombie film as a genre so maybe he's doing some really interesting stuff.  Doesn't feel like it, though.  At least when Wes Anderson uses Tilda Swinton in some kind of drag/kabuki performance, he's carefully constructed a world and story that supports it.  Also Chloe Sevigny is not the straight man.  Do better by her.  JJ is no Robert Altman." },
  { title: 'Rocketman', description: "A gay-sounding film critic on NPR told me to go see this, but now that I think of it, he might have been speaking to a general audience and not to me specifically.  I know that this was better than Bohemian Rhapsody of which I could only tolerate five minutes.  This film was EP'd by Elton John himself, so the fact that, by the end of it, the primary takeaway is that Elton John wrote a lot of good songs is not surprising.  Nor it is interesting or narratively satisfying.  Apparently, Elton John was just a deeply miserable person for whom even performing live was a drag.  Speaking of drag, Bryce Dallas Howard was woefully miscast doing a drag-quality \"working-class British mum\".  And Richard \"I guess there were no gay people available\" Madden needed subtitles.  I genuinely enjoyed about 20% of this film which I guess was enough for me to remain seated throughout its entirety.  Some good songs, wacky costumes, a tiny bit of gay stuff..." },
  { title: 'Wine Country', description: "I wanted this to be good because I love all of those broads, but I think the script was pretty flimsy.  The film really relied on its performers to elevate the somewhat formulaic plotting and plot complications.  For a story that tries to explore the challenges of being women of a certain age, it shies away from giving any of its characters really significant stakes.  This was released on Netflix, and that feels like smart choice.  This was not worth a theatrical release but worth watching in three installments on your Ikea Lovborg." },
  { title: 'Fyre Fraud', description: "I love stories about financial crimes.  What makes this doc \"better\" than the other doc on the same subject?  These filmmakers inexplicably got the subject to sit for an interview, and it's pretty fascinating to watch him realize that he's not selling his interviewers as he sold so many millenial rubes.  Also, this doc calls out the other one for having been financed/produced by the social media consulting group that worked on the Fyre Festival... Still though, the film stops short of saying something significant about the culture that created the conditions whereby the Fyre Festival happened.  Maybe there isn't actually much to say...when the \"victims\" of these crimes are rich white kids, isn't it a victimless crime?" },
  { title: 'Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened', description: "I have a tough time with films that try to make me feel bad for rich people, but films that want me to laugh at them?  I can do that.  The success of this film is in its compelling story.  There's nothing special about the filmmaking, though, and ultimately, it doesn't succeed in saying anything that isn't pretty obvious.  Millenials are vain?  QUOI?!?!?  People who are super-rich might not have earned their money legitimately.  REALLY?!?!?  Bros are gross.  GOT IT.  I'm interested enough in the story, though, to watch the competing Hulu Doc as well." },
  { title: 'Everybody Knows', description: "I almost walked out of this not because it was offensively bad but because I had been watching it for long enough.  The film gets progressively more boring after a fairly tight, interetsing first act.  The film couldn't decide if it was a thriller/mystery or a domestic drama, so it really failed on both fronts by not committing.  I actually wondered if some Spanish filmmakers watched Big Little Lies and thought we should do something like that.  They either needed to compress the action or turn it into a six-hour miniseries and actually explore some of these characters instead of just assuming that everybody knows.  I don't." },
  { title: 'Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood', description: "Brah, I did not like this.  I normally like QT's work at least as entertainment if not always as art.  I do not exactly know what he's up to here, but I can say for sure that it's not exploring the rich, complex lives of female characters.  There's something pretty masturbatory about Californians making films about Los Angeles and the film industry itself, and this does not rise above the level of self-gratification (or self-abuse for you Catholics).  What does he hope to gain by substituting the brutal murder of Sharon Tate (who here is really a non-character) with the brutal murders of some young female Mansonettes by a literal ladykiller who is set up, in spite of that, to be a hero of the film?  It's NOT a great look for 2019...or really for any time.  Leonardo DiCaprio is an amazing actor, though, and I really enjoy him in a comedy.  He's terrific here as a somewhat has-been, but the stakes for his character are low...which is why, I suppose, we needed the specter of a notorious, grisly murder hanging over us the entire time.  ALSO...the AMC 24 in Hamilton attracts the cinematic equivalent to the Kelsey audience...terrible taste, \"a bunch of rocks\"." },
  { title: 'Stuber', description: "Nah, brah.  Part of a double bill with The Art of Self-Defense.  Both were very violent.  Should have been a walkout...was a long trip to the bathroom and a nap instead." }
